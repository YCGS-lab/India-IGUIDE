    "Developed for the [_I-GUIDE Summer School on Spatial AI for Extreme Events and Disaster Resilience_](https://i-guide.io/summer-school/summer-school-2025/) (August 4–8, 2025), this notebook serves as the entry point to the RAP project documentation and provides links to the supporting analysis notebooks.\n",

    "## **Overview**\n",
    "The Risk Analysis Perception (RAP) Framework assesses perceptions of flood and drought risk across India using survey outcomes combined with geospatial and media features. The documentation consolidates methodology, datasets, modeling choices, and visualization outputs. The linked notebooks enable transparent navigation through data processing, model development, and results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives**\n",
    "- Quantify spatial variation in perceived flood and drought risk across Indian districts  \n",
    "- Evaluate how individual demographics and district-level environmental and media signals relate to perception  \n",
    "- Compare baseline and enhanced models that integrate remote sensing and learned embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Study Area and Unit of Analysis**\n",
    "- National coverage for India  \n",
    "- Individual survey responses linked to district identifiers for spatial aggregation and modeling\n",

    "*Evaluation*: We perform a 5 fold cross-validation during model training and 80-20 train test split for after model training validation. The 80-20 split is done by randmly dividing the country in 250 km square grids and randomly selecting 20% of these 250 km grids to separate validation districts. We do this to account for autocorrelation that may exist in the model.\n",
