    "## **Context**\n",
    "Developed for the I-GUIDE Summer School on “Spatial AI for Extreme Events and Disaster Resilience” (August 4–8, 2025). This notebook serves as the entry point to the RAP project documentation and links to the supporting analysis notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Overview**\n",
    "The Risk Analysis Perception (RAP) Framework assesses perceptions of flood and drought risk across India using survey outcomes combined with geospatial and media features. The documentation consolidates methodology, datasets, modeling choices, and visualization outputs. The linked notebooks enable transparent navigation through data processing, model development, and results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives**\n",
    "- Quantify spatial variation in perceived flood and drought risk across Indian districts  \n",
    "- Evaluate how individual demographics and district-level environmental and media signals relate to perception  \n",
    "- Compare baseline and enhanced models that integrate remote sensing and learned embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Study Area and Unit of Analysis**\n",
    "- National coverage for India  \n",
    "- Individual survey responses linked to district identifiers for spatial aggregation and modeling\n",

    "## **Data and Variables**\n",

    "### **Dependent Variable**\n",
    "- **Survey-based perception outcomes**  \n",
    "  - Example outcomes: perceived flood risk, perceived drought risk  \n",
    "  - Aggregated and modeled at individual level with district context\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Covariates**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Individual-level**\n",
    "- Age  \n",
    "- Gender  \n",
    "- Education  \n",
    "- Caste\n",

    "**District-level**\n",
    "- **News media**: web-scraped counts of flood-related mentions  \n",
    "- **Nighttime lights**: VIIRS radiance as a proxy for human activity and development  \n",
    "- **Learned representations**: Alpha Earth embeddings to capture latent environmental and built-environment signals  \n",
    "- **Climate reanalysis (ERA5)**  \n",
    "  - Monthly precipitation  \n",
    "  - Monthly temperature\n",

    "2. **Model 2**  \n",
    "   Model 1 plus district-level physical and media features  \n",
    "   Variables added: VIIRS radiance, ERA5 precipitation, ERA5 temperature, news mentions\n",

    "   Model 1 plus Alpha Earth embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model 4**  \n",
    "   Integrated model combining demographics, district-level features, and Alpha Earth embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "*Evaluation plan*: holdout or cross-validation at appropriate spatial units, compare RMSE and classification metrics when applicable, assess calibration and residual spatial structure.\n",

    "- **Model Tuning and Training**  \n",
    "  [02_Model.ipynb](./02_Model.ipynb)  \n",

    "## **Methods Summary**\n",
    "- **Preprocessing**: missing data handling, categorical encoding, scaling as needed  \n",
    "- **Spatial linkage**: survey responses associated with district codes; district-level covariates aligned by consistent spatial boundaries and time windows  \n",
    "- **Modeling**: compare generalized linear or tree-based models with and without embeddings; record seeds and configs for reproducibility  \n",
    "- **Validation**: report effect sizes or feature importances with uncertainty; inspect residuals for spatial autocorrelation\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Reproducibility**\n",
    "- Environment file: `environment.yml` with pinned versions  \n",
    "- Random seeds stored in notebook parameters or config files  \n",
    "- Outputs written to versioned folders: `outputs/{date}/...`  \n",
    "- Optional: parameterize runs with Papermill for batch execution\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Ethics and Limitations**\n",
    "- Survey privacy and de-identification  \n",
    "- Potential media bias and unequal reporting across districts  \n",
    "- Spatial and temporal mismatches between survey dates and covariate periods  \n",
    "- Embeddings are powerful but may encode confounders; interpretability checks recommended\n",
