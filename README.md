# Bridging the Risk Perception Gaps around Hazards (August 2025)
**I-GUIDE Team 1 Project**
India is among the countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. It has long been a key player in international climate negotiations and has begun implementing a diverse portfolio of policies nationally and within individual states to improve energy efficiency, develop clean energy sources, and prepare for the impacts of a changing climate. About 33 States and Union Territories have also announced state-level action plans to address climate change. Our recent national survey in India indicates that large majorities are worried about climate-related hazards, including severe heat waves (85%), droughts and water shortages (85%), and severe cyclones and floods (76% and 71%, respectively). 

Prior studies of public responses to climate change in India have often provided results only at the national level. For example, our recent national survey in India found that large majorities in India are worried about climate-related hazards, but until now we had little information about the diversity of climate opinions within the country. To better understand how opinions vary across India, we are pleased to present a new pioneering analysis and online interactive tool: Yale Climate Opinion Maps for India. For the first time, this tool provides estimates of public responses to climate change in 34 of Indiaâ€™s 36 states and Union territories, and in 604 districts, depicting the variation in global warming knowledge, beliefs, risk perceptions, and policy preferences at the state and local level across the country (see [Methods](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-awareness-india/)).
